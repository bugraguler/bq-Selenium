*** Screen Shots ***

Why do we need screenshots in testing?
It is very important to take screenshots in testing in order to prove that our test case covered certain functionality

In selenium in order to take a SS we will be usin TakeScreenShor interface

TakesScreenShot is an Interface.
To use it we need to do DownCasting!!!

/*

        TakesScreenshot ts=(TakesScreenshot)driver;
        File srcFile = ts.getScreenshotAs(OutputType.FILE); //the screenShot is taken on this step
        try {
            FileUtils.copyFile(srcFile,new File("screenShots/practiceSyntax/table.png"));
        } catch (IOException e) {
            throw new RuntimeException(e);
        }
