Alerts:
Alert is a popup message .Alert takes a complete focus of our main page that we are working on.
We cannot proceed until it is handled

3 Types of alerts:
1. Web based alerts / html alerts - we can simply inspect and perform need actions - we can handle like a normal element
2. Javascript alerts / browser alerts - we can handle these alerts by using switchTo method we can not inspect !!
3. Windows based alerts / we can not handle with Selenium !!!!!

Types of JavaScript alerts
1. Simple alert - click ok
2. Confirmation alert - either cancel or ok
3. Prompt alert - enter the text and than click ok or cancel

How to handle with javaScript alerts?
1. accept() - click ok
2. dismiss() - click cancel
3. getText()
4. sendKeys()

To handle authentication alerts we need to pass username and password in the URL
"https:////admin:admin@the-internet.herokuapp.com/basic_auth";
--username:password@
--Bazı sayfalar açılmadan username ve password isterler bunlarda username ve password direk url ye eklenir.

Frames
Frame is a seperate independent window in our webpage
Frames allows devs to represent multiple views on one page

3 ways to interact with frames:
1. by index
2. by name or ID
3. by Webelement

in alerts - switch to alert and switch automatically back
in frames - switch to a frame manually and switch manually back to the main page

Interview question:
How do you handle Alerts in Selenium?
We handle alerts by using Alert interface.
