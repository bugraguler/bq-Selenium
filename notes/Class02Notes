What is web element?
-- Anything we see on the web page is considered as a web element
e.g. buttons, textboxes, checkboxes, links

HTML?
-- HyperText MarkUp Language

What is DOM?
-- Stands for Document Object Model. It is the browser's internal view of the webpage
-- Also called as Developer's tools or Dev tools ** (right click and inspect)
Document --> Can be stored any document such as pdf, excel..
Object   --> Any line in HTML is considered as Object
Model    --> It is just a layout of the HTML

Locator?
is an address or position of an webelement on the web page
is used to locate or identify webelements on the web page

we have 8 Locators:
-ID
-Name
-TagName
-Class
-Xpath
-LinkText
-PartialLinkText
-CSS Selector


HTML Scripting Meaning:
purple -- tags = butoon , input, div
brown  -- attributes = name , class, id etc
blue   -- attribute value =can be everything

Why do we need many locators?
-- Developers may not provide all the locators for all the elements
-- Some locators may have duplicate values in different nodes
-- Some locators may not be applicable for the elements we are looking for
e.g. linktext and partialLinktext are only used for links

Note:if 2 or more elements have same attributes and attribute values ;
selenium will only interact with the first element it locates

Tags;
a -it is called "anchor tag" and it means there is a link in iy
