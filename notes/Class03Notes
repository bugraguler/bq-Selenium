Why do we need Xpath and Css Selector?
-- Developers will not provide all the locators in html
-- By using xpath and css we can identfy elements with any given attributes

What is an Xpath?
-- Xpath is like a query language which helps us to identify elements uniquely on the web page

Types of Xpath:
Absolute Xpath -> starts from the starting node in html
                  it always starts with single slash
                  e.g./html/body/div/div
                  IT IS OLD THING KULLANILMIYOR

Relative Xpath ->starts from any node in html
                 it always starts with double slash(//)

Syntax for relative Xpath:
//tagname[@attribute = 'attribute value']
//input[@id = 'email']

Identifying elements by its text:yhis is also relative xpath
//tagname[text() = 'text value']
//h2[text() = 'Connect with friends and the world around you on Facebook.']
//a[text() = 'Create new account']

identifying elements by using contains method
//tagname[contains(@attribute, 'partial attribute value')]
//input[contains(@placeholder, 'Email')]
//h2[contains(text(), 'Facebook')]

Starts-with will identify the element with partial starting value
//tagname[starts-with(@attribute, 'partial starting attribute value')]
//button[starts-with(@data-testid, 'royal')]

<div> -- division
<img> -- image
<h>   -- header
<p>   -- paragraph
<li>  -- list
<ul>  -- unordered list
<ol>  -- ordered list
<br>  -- breaking line

Advanced Xpath is based on parent and child, sibling relationships
identifying elements by following sibling
//tagname[@attribute = 'attribute value']/following-sibling::tagname
//input[@id = 'calFromDate']/following-sibling::img

identifying elements by preceding siblings
//tagname[@attribute = 'attribute value']/preceding-sibling::tagname
//span[text() = '& Orders']/preceding-sibling::span
//input[@id = 'calFromDate']/preceding-sibling::label

identifying elements by parents
//tagname[@attribute = 'attribute value']/parent::parentTagName
//span[text() = '& Orders']/parent::a

identifying an element by its ancestor(anything above the parent will be consider as ancestor)
//tagname[@attribute = 'attribute value']/ancestor::ancestorTagname
//input[@id = 'email']/ancestor::form

identifying element by index
(//img[@class = 'ui-datepicker-trigger'])[2]

id="u_0_d_YY"  --> it is not reliable id --> it means it might change maybe in the future or each refresh !!!
