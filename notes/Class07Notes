Handling multiple windows (tabs):
In order for us to handle windows we will be using :
getWindowHandle()
getWindowHandles()

WindowHandle:
It is a unique ID that holds the address of window or a tab
It is approximately a 40 alphanumeric charackter ID

Syncronization:
is the process of bringing the speed of two or more components the same level
in this case we are bringing out script and page load to the same speed level

Thread.sleep() -- static wait / unconditional wait

Types of selenium waits:
Implicit wait
Explicit wait
Fluent wait - not used much

Implicit wait:
-waits until locate the element
-it tells the webDriver to wait a certain amount of time before throwing exception
-it will only be written once and will be applied to whole session of the execution
-We can say that Implicit wait is a global wait
-Basically works with findElement() method.
-Usually we set the time 20 sec - If your element is found in any time between the given time
the remaining time will be ignored and your script will move on the next line or action
-If the element is not found in given time, ONLY then you will get an exception
